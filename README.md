# preflight

![Build Release](https://github.com/sullrich84/preflight/workflows/Build%20Release/badge.svg)

*preflight* is a *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing* testing tool for your terminal. 
*Cross-Origin Resource Sharing* is a relevant security mechanism every web 
developer has to face at a certain point in their projects. *preflight* is here 
to help. It was created to support you in this process by speeding up the 
configuration and testing.

### How does it work?

*preflight* will emulate the browsers preflight requests in your terminal. Just 
provide the `target` you want to pre-fly, one or more `origins` the request will 
be made from and *preflight* will tell you if configured your *Cross-Origin 
Resource Sharing Response Headers* correctly.

### How can I get preflight?

*preflight* is available for MacOSX, *Linux and Windows. You can find 
the binaries in [GitHubs release section](https://github.com/sullrich84/preflight/releases).
