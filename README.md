# preflight

![Build Release](https://github.com/sullrich84/preflight/workflows/Build%20Release/badge.svg)

`preflight` is a *Cross-Origin Resource Sharing* testing tool for your terminal. 
*Cross-Origin Resource Sharing* is a relevant security mechanism every web 
developer has to face at a certain point in their projects. `preflight` is here 
to help - it was created to support you in this process by speeding up the 
configuration and testing.

### How does it work?

`preflight` will emulate the browsers *preflight* from your terminal. Just 
provide the `target` you want to pre-fly, one or more `origins` the request will 
be made from and `preflight` handles the rest.  

# How can I get preflight?

`preflight` is available for **MacOSX**, **Linux** and **Windows**. You can find 
the binaries in [GitHubs release section](https://github.com/sullrich84/preflight/releases).
